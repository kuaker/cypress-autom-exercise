# Project Structure and settings
The project was built using cypress framework with Typescript.
I used POM (Page Object Model).
I set it up to run it in differents environments (/config)
I used assert-pages in order to reuse assertions
I created some data generators for reusability.
I set it up to run it on github actions in parallel.


# Comments
IÂ´ve tried to implement BDD by using cucumber library but I had some issues with the plugin and configuration for cypress 10.0.0 and over version with typescript.
